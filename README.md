# Welcome to Xpress AI

To get you started, you will find a few ready to run template 
Agents above.  This is what they do:

## Simplicity

Simplicity is intended to be like a customizable Perplexity 
clone.  Simplicity, like Perplexity, can search the web and
perform simple research tasks.  It is intentionally left
pretty bare-bones because sometimes as a user, you just 
want to talk to GPT-4o or Anthropic in a chatbot style 
and not really integrate into anything.

Feel free to change the model in the AgentInit component
to anything supported by relay and restarting the agent.

If you do want to talk to different models often, you can
make another agent and add it to this xircuits file.

If you wish that the agent was able to also search Google
Drive, or Sharepoint, just add those integrations in the 
tools, and go beyond what Perplexity could provide.

## Lexi

Lexi is an agent that has the ability to read and understand 
PDF files.

Lexi is useful as a knowledge base assistant for company 
policies, HR or legal use cases.

Use the LexiOnboarding to run the agent in Learn Mode.  
It will remember as much as it can from your 
conversations with it.

You can then hook Lexi up to e-mail or Slack to assist your 
company.
